This is the code for the article I wrote on medium: https://medium.com/@arpith/using-react-router-1f96209fe557#.92v3xhq7l

## Try it out!
1. `git clone https://github.com/arpith/react-router-example`
2. `cd react-router-example`
3. `npm install && npm start`

Head over to <a href="localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a> to see it in action.
